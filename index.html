            <h2>Why Athens?</h2>
            <p>
              Athens, historic city and capital of Greece. Many of Classical
              civilization's intellectual and artistic ideas originated there,
              and the city is generally considered to be the birthplace of
              Western civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Athens, with its tall buildings and contemporary shops, is the
              first European city when approached from the Middle East. When
              approached from the west, from elsewhere in Europe, what strikes
              the visitor is the influence of the East—in the food, music, and
              clamorous street life—perhaps vestiges of a time when Athens was
              divorced from European society under the yoke of Ottoman rule.
              Nevertheless, it is wrong to say that Athens is a mixture of East
              and West: it is Greek and, more particularly, Athenian. The city,
              after all, nurtured Western civilization thousands of years ago.
              Athens remains on the world stage to this day.
